#### 1. In this part, we will be adding another button and changing up some styling.

- Wrap the <button> tag we added inside of a <div>. Add a className called styles.flex to that <div>. Make sure the <button> is inside of it.
- Then, add another <button> inside the <div> tag and put "Goodbye" inside of it.
- In ./styles/Home.module.css, add a new style for the "flex" class, and inside of it, add one line: display: flex.
- Your page should now look like this:


#### 2. Now we're going to add an action to your new button.

- To your second button, add an onClick handler and call a function named printGoodbye.
- Define a new function called printGoodbye under the printHello function
- Make it console.log "Goodbye"
